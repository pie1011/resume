    <div class="card-body">
      <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> This project involved designing a Talent Lifecycle Development Plan for K-edtech Solutions to demonstrate the strategic management of talent from attraction through retention. The objective was to analyze how Learning & Development (L&D) influences each stage of the employee lifecycle, create development initiatives that align individual growth with organizational priorities, and propose retention strategies grounded in continuous learning and career progression.</p>
      <p><strong>Processes:</strong> The plan was structured around three core phases: Attraction, Development, and Retention. To attract talent, the strategy leveraged L&D branding, highlighting K-edtech's upskilling culture and career advancement pathways on job postings and onboarding materials. During the development phase, the proposal included a digital onboarding track with interactive modules, peer mentorship, and goal-setting frameworks to accelerate integration and learning.

Retention strategies emphasized continuous learning through quarterly learning sprints, adaptive microlearning, and gamified progress tracking. Managers received coaching resources and pulse survey templates to monitor engagement and adjust support. A strong emphasis was placed on aligning learning objectives with career paths, empowering employees to pursue visible growth milestones. This Creative and Empathetic approach ensured a learner-first experience while remaining strategically aligned with business goals.</p>
      <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The anticipated outcomes included faster onboarding times, higher internal mobility, and improved engagement and retention. Key projections featured a 30% reduction in time-to-productivity for new hires and increased internal promotion rates within one year. By embedding learning into every stage of the talent lifecycle, the plan would demonstrate a Responsible, Helpful, and Leader-like strategy for developing a future-ready workforce while supporting organizational success.</p>
